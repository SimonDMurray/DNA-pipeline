output fastq.gz in trimmomatic not fastq as takes up less space and quicker
using reference Homo_sapiens_assembly38.fasta
dont need soapec bc not doing reassembly

no trimming needed as platinum genome
need to do BaseRecalibration and BQSR before Haplotype caller to refine data further into high quality
removed genomic intervals in haplotypecaller to cover entire genome, speed isnt issue as data is higher quality due to further refinement
reference genome has extra genomic information for known chromosome regions that are counted as separate chromosomes, these are removed
need to use difference version of java for fastqc so need to change path variable at one point
in bash script used relative paths so someone could implement pipeline from a clone (assuming all installs were correct) without having to change paths (although PATH variable would need to be updated)
commandline results and galaxy results share 3 genomice loci, command line has 4 total genomic loci, galaxy has 5 total genomic loci. Command line includes some extra known indel removals so this could be reason
